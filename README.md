##7 Segment Button Counter

This sketch displays an initialization animation and 
starts a decimal counter that counts down when a button 
is pressed. Hardware is one shift register, a button, 
and a 7-seg. Biggest problem is that the button must
be pressed twice in order to go from 9 to 8. This only 
occurs after the animation though.


This was intended to be the start of an ammo counter for a Nerf gun I was modifying. I broke the Nerf gun before I finished it :(
